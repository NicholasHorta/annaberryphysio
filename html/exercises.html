                <p>
                    You may experience sacroiliac (SI)joint pain as a sharp, stabbing pain that radiates from your hips
                    and pelvis, up to the lower back, and down to the thighs. Sometimes it may feel numb or tingly, or
                    as if your legs are about to buckle.The SI joint is to blame in 15 to 30 percent of people with
                    chronic lower back pain.
                    About 80 percent of adults in South Africa will experience lower back pain during their lives. Lower
                    back pain is a leading cause of missed workdays, and the most common cause of job-related
                    disability. Exercise can help to alleviate pain as well as strengthen muscle that are known to cause
                    this pain.
